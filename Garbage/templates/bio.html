        <h3 class="">Definition</h3>
        <P>Bio waste, or biological waste, consists of organic materials that can decompose naturally. This
        includes food scraps, garden waste, and other biodegradable materials.</P>

        <h3>Composition</h3>
        <ul>
        <li>Food Waste: Fruits, vegetables, dairy, meat, and grains.</li>
        <li>Garden Waste: Leaves, grass clippings, branches, and other plant material.</li>
        <li>Animal Waste: Manure from livestock and pets.</li>
        <li>Paper Products: Non-toxic paper items like napkins and cardboard (if uncoated).</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Disposal Methods</h3>
        <ul>
        <li>Composting: Organic waste is collected and decomposed naturally, creating nutrient-rich compost for gardens and
        agriculture.</li>
        <li>Anaerobic Digestion: Bio waste is broken down by microorganisms in the absence of oxygen, producing biogas for
        <li>Anaerobic Digestion: Bio waste is broken down by microorganisms in the absence of oxygen, producing biogas for
        energy and digestate for fertilizer.</li>
        <li>Landfilling: While not ideal, some bio waste may still end up in landfills. Itâ€™s crucial to minimize this to
        reduce methane emissions.</li>
        <li>Incineration: This method involves burning bio waste to reduce its volume, though it can release pollutants if
        not managed properly.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Benefits of Proper Disposal</h3>
        <ul>
        <li>Reduces landfill volume</li>
        <li>Produces compost for soil enrichment</li>
        <li></li>Lowers greenhouse gas emissions</li>
        <li>Effective bio waste management is essential for a sustainable environment. Encourage separation at the source to
        optimize recycling and composting efforts!</li>
